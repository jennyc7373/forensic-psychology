#### Development of a Personality
Why are criminals a criminal? What is it that made them turn into a criminal?

The point of forensic psychology was to help determining a persons personality and explain the victim's or criminal's actions or emotions in court cases. 
Even with the case solved the crime rates still continues to rise.

The personality is developed from nurture and nature. The way a parent discipline their child can affect how the child will be towards other people in society. For example, an abusive parent can make their child also abusive in adulthood or the child can have no self-confidence and always afraid to disobey the demands of others. Personality is complex and can develop in many ways through the life span of a person.

Post-tramtic stress disorder(PTSD) or just trauma in general affects a childs personality. Trauma leaves a memory in the long-term memory of the brain that makes it hard for a person to forget. Without someone supporting the person suffering from PTSD, they might succumb into their fears and be antisocial. 

There are many more factors in life that can affect the development of a person. If is child was disciplined, supported, and cared well then they can develop a good personality. This can decrease the crime rates.
